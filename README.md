# 🧬 Colon Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building an **automated system for colon cancer classification** using **deep learning techniques**.  
The aim is to assist in the **early detection of colon cancer** by analyzing medical images and classifying them into cancerous and non-cancerous categories.  
By leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the project improves diagnostic accuracy and reduces the dependency on manual inspection by pathologists.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **TensorFlow / Keras** → Deep learning model building  
- **NumPy & Pandas** → Data handling  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** → Visualization  
- **Flask / Tkinter (optional)** → For model deployment and GUI  

---

## 📊 Dataset
The project uses a **publicly available colon cancer dataset** consisting of histopathology images.  
Each image is labeled as either:
- **Cancerous**  
- **Non-cancerous**  

Features include:
- High-resolution microscopic images  
- Different tissue structures for training and testing  

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Preprocessing of medical images (resizing, normalization, augmentation)  
- ✅ CNN-based model for colon cancer classification  
- ✅ Accuracy and loss graphs for training/validation performance  
- ✅ Option for deployment using Flask/Tkinter GUI  
- ✅ Model capable of real-time prediction on unseen images
